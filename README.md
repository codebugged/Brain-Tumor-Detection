# Brain-Tumor-Detection 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on a combination of deep-learning algorithms and laser-imaging technology can be utilized to examine brain tissue and detect a brain tumor in near real-time

# Hey!
This is Simple project which is based on implementation of Deep Learning into a medical product.

What all you need to do?

1. Set up the following requirements
Tensorflow==1.15.0, Numpy==1.18.2, PIL, Keras==2.2.5, and OpenCV

2. Fork my pre-trained model (I often call it as my pre-built AI)

3. Pass the test data as 'test_photo.jpg'

4. Now execute the Program.ipynb file.
